# Alexa Skill: CongressWatch

## Starting Out

Our original idea for the project was to build an Alexa skill that would give daily briefings on bill dockets and
results.  
To do this we had to research not only how to build an Alexa skill, but also how to utilize a 3rd party API to retrieve
the information.  
After reviewing a few sites we settled on ProPublica.org as they appear to be the main API source for other sites and we
were able to aquire an API key.  
Initial research in how to utilize a 3rd party API with a key was difficult as we were unable to get the site to accept
the key.  
We then decided to build a test Alexa skill where we could get everything working with an open API key. This is the
repository and additional ReadMe for this app.
